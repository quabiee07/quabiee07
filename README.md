# Yo, it's Ebuka!👋 Flutter Developer 🚀

Alright, so you've landed on my GitHub! I'm all about diving into Flutter and Dart to build mobile apps that are not just cool to look at, but also run super smooth and feel great to use. Seriously love that moment an idea clicks into code and creates an awesome user experience – it's pure magic! 🪄✨

## 📌 Quick Overview

* 🔭 I’m currently working on **["QUEEK", an app for students within a campus, enabling peer-to-peer service exchange.]** and exploring advanced Flutter animations.
* 🌱 I’m continuously learning and refining my skills in Flutter, Dart, state management (e.g., Riverpod, BLoC & Provider -which is my fave cause of it's simplicity) and clean architecture.
* 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on innovative and impactful Flutter projects. If you have an idea, let's chat!
* 💬 Ask me about anything Flutter, Dart, or mobile development related!
* 📫 How to reach me: **kingsleyihekwaba208@gmail.com**
* ⚡ Fun fact: I get as much thrill from architecting a smooth Flutter UI as I do from watching an epic anime fight scene or clutching a 1v4 in CODM.
